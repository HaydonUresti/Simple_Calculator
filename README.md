# Overview

This application is a simple calculator. It is able to handle negative and floating point numbers in addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The calculator is used through the us of the mouse to click on buttons on a GUI inputting data to the calculator.

My purpose for writing the app is to learn about and practice C# and the .Net framework.

# Future Work

- Implement more types of operations such as scientific operations.
- Change the use of the Character 'n' to a '-' for the use of negatives.
- Enable the user to use multiple operations at a time.

# Operation

## Capabilities 
Simple Calculator works similarly to other calculators. Two numbers may be added, subtracted, multiplied, divided, and raised to a power. Simple Calculator also allows for negative and decimal numbers. Furthermore, the app is able to recall the previous answer in order to perform further operations on it. 

## Perform Calculations 
To perform a calculation, begin by inputting the first number of the operation. To do so use the mouse or touchpad to click on the desired numbers. Next, click on the desired operation, then click on the second number needing to be calculated. Finally, click on the "Calc" button and the answer will be displayed on the display. Note that only one operation may be performed at a time, and only two numbers may be operated on (i.e. 1119 + 281). Differing amounts of numbers or operations will result in error messages. 

## Recall Answers 
The previous answer may be recalled to operate on by clicking the "ANS" button. This will then display the previously calculated number. 

## Delete Characters 
Characters may be deleted individually by clicking the "DELETE" button. Doing so will delete the previously entered character on the display. To delete all characters on the display, click the "Clear" button.

## Special Numbers
### Negatives
In order to use enter negative numbers, press the "neg" button. Doing so will cause the letter "n" to be displayed. The number entered after the "n" will be treated as a negative number. 
### Decimals
A decimal number may be used by pressing the "." button. Clicking it will cause a "." to be displayed turning the number into a decimal number. It is not necessary to include a number before the decimal (i.e..55)
