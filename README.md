# Overview

This application is a simple calculator. It is able to handle negative and floating point numbers in addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The calculator is used through the us of the mouse to click on buttons on a GUI inputting data to the calculator.

My purpose for writing the app is to learn about and practice C# and the .Net framework.
